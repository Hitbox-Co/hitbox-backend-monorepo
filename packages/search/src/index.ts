 * Search index jobs — the outbox feeding the search/discover index.
 *
 * Schema-only at this stage: this module owns its Prisma partial under
 * ./prisma, which shared/database merges into the generated schema. The
 * repository / service / controller layers land here as the feature is
 * built — see docs/database-architecture.md for the ownership map.
